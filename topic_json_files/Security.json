    "Content": "Security (Handled by Dimple)   SIS security agency is deployed in UNITs 1,2,4 and G4S is deployed in UNIT 3   Gate VMS system is linked with the HRMS system   a. Developed in house   b. IT support is also in house   Flow when a visitor comes to meet employee Joe   c. If Joe has punched in then he will get an OTP when a visitor comes to meet him.   i. The guard captures the following user data to enter in the VMS software   1. Visitor name   2. Contact number of visitor   3. Reason of visit   4. Name of company if applicable   5. Picture of visitor   6. These details are only required for one visitor. So If I have 3 people with me then we only need to provide info of one person to get in   ii. An OTP is generated by the guard manually using VMS software.   1. The VMS software is error prone as it is a manual job. If visitor came to meet Joe and the guard by mistake selected Jane in the software then the OTP goes to Jane   iii. This OTP is used to enter the premise iv. There is no database for past visitors so If I came on Monday to meet Joe then I have to register all my data and when I come on Tuesday to meet Joe again I have to enter in the same data.   v. The monthly MIS report is generated through the VMS software in excel format and then given to management.   d. If Joe has not punched in then he has to ask a colleague to generate the pass for his visitor (There is no facility for visitors for late employees)   e. A visitor can only be there for staff and upper employees. If a visitor comes to visit a worker for purposes like loan verification then the pass is generated in the name of the HOD of the worker. Problems   1. What if an important person came, and they talked to upper management about the meeting, and we dont want to treat that person as other visitors."
