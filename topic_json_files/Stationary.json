    "Content": "Stationary (Handled by Niyati)   Every 25th or 26th of the month a mail is sent to the Admins of all the units to get a list requirements from each unit.   Along with a mail to each admin a mail to every department is also sent to a randomly chosen department representative to get an estimate of the department needs.   a. This mail consists of a Zoho form which has 6 pages and 120 commonly used stationary items in it   b. The response of this form goes to the reception where it is given to the admin in printed form.   c. If a department needs an item not in the list then there are 2 cases for this situation   i. The item number is registered in inventory but not given in the item list. In this case the admin manually maps the requested item to an existing item in the inventory.   ii. Item is totally new. Then the item has to get registered using the following process:   1. A mail is sent using ERP to generate item code. This mail consists of the list of items in a fixed excel format with the following columns:   a. Item name   b. Item desc (limit of 40 chars)   c. Detailed desc   d. Item class   e. Item subclass   2. This is then sent for approval to management through mail for code creation along with budget and new vendor approvals if applicable.   3. After approval these details are sent to the ERP dept to create a new item code and this code is given to the concerned admin through mail.   4. Admin uses this code to fill rate, tax structure, purchase setting in the ERP software.   a. Without these details the PO for the item cannot be created in the ER software   5. The Rate is approved via the admin’s immediate supervisor.   6. Then PO can be generated using the ERP software and we need to Map the new item to its vendor (new or old) for the first time.   These requirements are then compared against the current stock for procurement estimation.   The requirements are then drafted in an excel format and sent to management through mail for budget approvals with details like the budget for last month, this month and reason for fluctuations if applicable.   After approval the admin generates the PO through ERP software and orders the material from fixed vendors for each item.   d. A mail is sent to the concerned vendor with the PO   e. The PO under 1 lakh is approved through the immediate supervisor   f. The PO over 1 lakh can only be approved by the Department head and they don't have a limit for the PO size   g. The rates for each vendor are fixed for a financial year and are revised in February.   h. After approval we get option to download PO as PDF   i. Supply Reg Form format:    i. Reg Number (Via ERP)  ii. Name  iii. Category iv. Sign of HOD, supervisor, management and the person in ERP who generated the code.   When the material arrives then there needs to be an inward process at the gate   For the inward process the person who brings the material goes to the store to verify the invoice against the PO.    j. Eg if the PO is for a 100 pens and the invoice is generated for 75 pens then an informal communication is done from the store manager to the concerned admin representative that 25 pens are missing so the PO will still be kept open. Now the next shipment cannot be done for more than 25 pens. It can be 20 (PO will still be open for 5 pens) but it cannot be 25.   After the store manager verifies all the details in the invoice match the PO in the ERP system (even long and short descriptions) then he gives the invoice a “D” stamp to be shown at the gate.   k. This checking is manual, time taking and prone to errors   The D stamp is then shown to the security at the gate to fill the inward sheet (This sheet is also audited) and the material can then be unloaded   When unloaded the quantity of the items are checked manually   l. If the count matches then GRN number is generated to add the item to stock   m. If the count does not match then a new invoice is generated for the incorrect count and communicated through whatsapp or mail and the PO is still kept open if the items received are less than the PO. A GRN number is then generated against this new invoice.   After the stock is added to the inventory the concerned admin person is not notified automatically.   When the material is received then using the ERP  software a requisition form is filled with the following details:   n. Category (Admin)   o. Receiver (name of person who requested the stationary item)   p. Item Codes   q. Quantities   r. Remarks   After filling the form an ER number is generated which is noted down manually   This ER number is then used to approve the requisition request via the admins immediate supervisor. The immediate supervisor has access to this ER number in his dashboard but he does not know which request is from whom so this number needs to be manually forwarded every time.   After this the issue to shop floor form is filled with the following details   s. Category   t. Person Name   u. ER number from prev step   v. Quantity (This is used to reduce the quantity from stock)   A number is generated for this process and kept in records manually and is useful when we want to undo the issue to shop floor process.   If an item is defective then this number is used to revert the issue to shop floor possess (return issue to shop floor).   If the number of items with issue are limited then they are replaced by the vendor informally   If the number of items is high in quantity then the following procedure take place:   Return issue to shop floor is done discussed in step point 17   Vendor Rejection Note (VRN) is generated in the Quality Control department (communication done via mail)   This VRN is manually printed and given to the admin to sign   A copy of the VRN is sent to the accounts department to make a debit note for the previous invoice. The payment cycle is of 30 days so the amount is deducted from the payment."
